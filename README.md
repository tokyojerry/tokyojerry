- 👋 Hi, I’m @tokyojerry, a permanent resident of Japan. I speak, read, and write Japanese graduating from the University of Hawaii with a B.A. in Japanese language.
- 👀 I’m interested in some applications and I follow up on their development but, I am NOT a programmer. 
- 🌱 I self-educate myself at this stage in life with various interests.  I am retired but a self-learner.  Occasionally I do freelance projects related to TV talent, 
- and wedding services industry in Tokyo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, nothing really.  I’m interested in some applications, usually to check if there has been any development progress, however I am NOT a programmer.
- YiNote is one such application in particular.  It seems there has been no development on that app though for almost a year.
